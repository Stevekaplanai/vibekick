# VibeKick.co - Product Brief

## Your Vibe Coding Sidekick

### Vision

VibeKick is a Chrome extension that supercharges vibe coding by providing instant access to curated, fill-in-the-blank prompts for any coding scenario. Stop writing prompts from scratch - just search, customize, and copy.

### The Problem

Vibe coders waste time:
1. Writing similar prompts over and over
2. Forgetting effective prompt patterns
3. Context-switching to find saved prompts
4. Manually formatting prompts for different use cases

### The Solution

A lightweight Chrome extension that:
- **Quick Search**: Find the right prompt in seconds
- **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Customize prompts with your specific context
- **One-Click Copy**: Paste directly into any LLM
- **Use Case Categories**: Organized by common vibe coding tasks

### Target Users

- Developers using AI coding assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
- "Vibe coders" who build with natural language
- Teams wanting consistent prompt patterns

### Core Use Cases

1. **Start a new feature** - "Build me a [feature] using [tech stack]"
2. **Debug an error** - "I'm getting [error] when [action], here's the code..."
3. **Refactor code** - "Refactor this [code type] to be more [quality]"
4. **Write tests** - "Write [test type] tests for [component]"
5. **Explain code** - "Explain what this [language] code does..."
6. **API integration** - "Integrate [service] API to [action]"
7. **Database queries** - "Write a query to [action] from [table]"
8. **UI components** - "Create a [component] with [styling framework]"
